# XRD-file-resample
a simple program aimed to resample diffraction files with desired 2theta step (normally larger than the raw file)
# How it works: 
# Browse Directory:
The "Browse" button allows the user to select a directory containing the .dat file(s) intended for resampling.

# Enter Step Size:
The user enters the desired step size for resampling.

# Run Resampling:
The "Run Resampling" button triggers the resampling process for all .dat files in the selected directory.

The script reads each .dat file, resamples the #2th values based on the step size, and saves the resampled data in a new file with "_resampled" added to the original filename.

# Output:
The resampled file is saved in the same directory as the original file, with the name pattern: original_filename_resampled.dat.
